# Description
This script can be used to help you solve the daily Wordle puzzle. Whether you want to export some or all of the "thinking" to the algorithm , there is a mode for you.

# Instructions
1. While in alpha stages of development, this program must be run through an IDE (integrated development environment) via the main.py file found in the src folder. Due to python folder management intricacies, VSCode is reccomended and will work the best with this program.
2. Download all of the files and extract the zip file. Everything this program does will be via the terminal as there is currently no gui for it.
3. After ensuring all of the files are in the same folder, please run the main.py file found in the src  folder. From there, follow the instructions in the terminal to solve all of your Wordle Puzzles!
